# Copilot Instructions: Cogfaithup

## Architecture
- Use modular, maintainable code (separate cogs, listeners, and commands)
- Use environment variables for config and secrets
- Use async/await for all async code
- Use Red-DiscordBot and discord.py best practices

## Cross-Domain
- Never commit secrets or credentials
- Validate and sanitize all user input
- Document all commands and listeners

## Innovation
- Prioritize accessibility in bot responses (clear, concise, and mention users)
- Use descriptive docstrings and help text for commands
- Add tests for all new features

## Documentation
- Update README for all major changes
- Document all commands, listeners, and environment variables
- Add code comments for complex logic

## General
- Use .gitignore to exclude .env, __pycache__, and sensitive files
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
